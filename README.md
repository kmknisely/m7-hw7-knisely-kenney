The only issues I had during this assignment was accessing the step by step instructions to install npm and babel. That was solved though so I was able to figure everything out!

I am, however, getting a security message in git about a vulnerable dependency in the 'package-lock.json' file? I think it's a non issue though. 

Sites I used for this project were:

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp
  - I wanted to make sure I was spelling mouseenter correctly. I also used W3 to double check syntax on properties for CSS. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43931538/how-to-load-es6-react-babel-code-in-html-with-cdn
  - I techincally checked stackoverflow a lot when trying to figure out what I was missing in babel. Turns out I wasn't missing anything and a lot of the articles here weren't really relevant. I did use this resource though so I figured it was worth mentioning.
